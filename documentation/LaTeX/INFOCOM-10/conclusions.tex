We have introduced Synapse, a scalable protocol for information
retrieval in heterogeneous inter-connected overlay networks relying on
co-located nodes.  Synapse is a generic and flexible
\emph{meta}-protocol which provides simple mechanisms and algorithms
for easy overlay networks' interconnection. We have given the set of
algorithms behind our protocols and provided a set of simulations
allowing to capture the behavior of such networks and shows their
relevance in the context of information retrieval, using key metrics
of distributed information retrieval. We have also developed {\tt
JSynapse}, a lightweight implementation of Synapse, and experimented
it on the Grid'5000 platform, thus confirming our simulation and
giving a proof of concept of our protocol.

As future work, we first intend to focus on social mechanisms involved
in synapses, which can greatly influence the shape of the network. On
the practical side, we plan to extend {\tt JSynapse} and plug in some
other overlay network implementations. More intensive tests and
deployments of {~\tt{open-synapse}}, our early prototype based on {\tt
open-chord} will also be considered.
