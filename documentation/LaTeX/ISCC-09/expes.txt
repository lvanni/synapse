Assumptions:
	- heterogeneous processing capacity of peers (number of requests they are able to process per second)
	- heterogeneous storage capacity of peers (we can assume a node can not store its part of the table)
	- heterogeneous RTT of each link
	- possibility to tune the number of floors visited at each hop (ringTTL)


Experiments:

	- Lookup length (number of hops) VS ringTTL
	- Lookup length (number of hops) VS different policies of creation of a new ring

	- Lookup latency (time) VS different policies of creation of a new ring
	- Lookup latency (time) compared to basic chord

	- proportion of failed lookup VS churn rate
	- proportion of failed lookup VS ringTTL
	- proportion of failed lookup VS different policies of creation of a new ring
	- proportion of failed lookup compared to basic chord

	- exhaustivity, size of the global table, number of (key,value) pairs that are stored on peers
			- VS different policies of creation of a new ring
			- compared to basic chord
