   abstract    = {Structured overlay networks is an important and
                 interesting primitive that can be used by diverse
                 peer-to-peer applications. Multiple overlays can result
                 either because of network partitioning or (more likely)
                 because different groups of peers build such overlays
                 separately before coming in contact with each other and
                 wishing to coalesce the overlays together. This paper is
                 a first look into how multiple such overlays (all using
                 the same protocols) can be merged - which is critical for
                 usability and adoption of such an internet-scale
                 distributed system. We elaborate how two networks using
                 the same protocols can be merged, looking specifically
                 into two different overlay design principles: (i)
                 maintaining the ring invariant and (ii) structural
                 replications, either of which are used in various overlay
                 networks to guarantee functional correctness in a highly
                 dynamic (membership changes) environment. Particularly,
                 we show that ring based networks can not operate until
                 the merger operation completes. In contrast, from the
                 perspective of individual peers in structurally
                 replicated overlays there is no disruption of service,
                 and they can continue to discover and access resources
                 that they could originally do before the beginning of the
                 merger process, even though resources from the other
                 network become visible only gradually with the progress
                 of the merger process.},
