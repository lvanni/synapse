	abstract = {This paper examines the latency in Internet path failure, failover and repair due to the convergence properties of inter-domain routing. Unlike switches in the public telephony network which exhibit failover on the order of milliseconds, our experimental measurements show that inter-domain routers in the packet switched Internet may take tens of minutes to reach a consistent view of the network topology after a fault. These delays stem from temporary routing table oscillations formed during the operation of the {BGP} path selection process on Internet backbone routers. During these periods of delayed convergence, we show that end-to-end Internet paths will experience intermittent loss of connectivity, as well as increased packet loss and latency. We present a two-year study of Internet routing convergence through the experimental instrumentation of key portions of the Internet infrastructure, including both passive data collection and fault-injection machines at major Internet exchange points. Based on data from the injection and measurement of several hundred thousand inter-domain routing faults, we describe several unexpected properties of convergence and show that the measured upper bound on Internet inter-domain routing convergence delay is an order of magnitude slower than previously thought. Our analysis also shows that the upper theoretic computational bound on the number of router states and control messages exchanged during the process of {BGP} convergence is factorial with respect to the number of autonomous systems in the Internet. Finally, we demonstrate that much of the observed convergence delay stems from specific router vendor implementation decisions and ambiguity in the {BGP} specification.},

These problems arise from the basic assumption of {BGP:} every router has to cooperate to make routing work. We propose a new routing system, feedback based routing, which bifurcates structural information and dynamic information. Only structural information is propagated. Dynamic information is discovered by the routers based on feedback and probes. Routing decisions are made based on the dynamic information. We argue that this system is resilient to minority compromises in the infrastructure, provides higher availability than {BGP,} and can scale to the size of the Internet of the future.},

One could sidestep this quandary by routing directly on host identities themselves, and eliminating the need for network-layer protocols to include any mention of network location. The key to achieving this is the ability to route on flat labels. In this paper we take an initial stab at this challenge, proposing and analyzing our {ROFL} routing algorithm. While its scaling and efficiency properties are far from ideal, our results suggest that the idea of routing on flat labels cannot be immediately dismissed.},

User choice fosters competition, which imposes an economic discipline on the market, and fosters innovation and the introduction of new {services.This} paper explores various technical problems that would have to be solved to give users the ability to choose: how a user discovers routes and whether the dynamic conditions of the routes satisfy his requirements, how to efficiently represent routes, and how to properly compensate providers if a user chooses to use them. In particular, {NIRA} utilizes a hierarchical provider-rooted addressing scheme so that a common type of domain-level route can be efficiently represented by a pair of addresses. In {NIRA,} each user keeps track of the topology information on domains that provide transit service for him. A source retrieves the topology information of the destination on demand and combines this information with his own to discover end-to-end routes. This route discovery process ensures that each user does not need to know the complete topology of the Internet.},

In specific, a revised version of the {TCP/IP} layered architecture would only suffice to address some of the current issues, but would not provide a long term solution.

@InProceedings{Datta,
   abstract    = {Structured overlay networks is an important and
                 interesting primitive that can be used by diverse
                 peer-to-peer applications. Multiple overlays can result
                 either because of network partitioning or (more likely)
                 because different groups of peers build such overlays
                 separately before coming in contact with each other and
                 wishing to coalesce the overlays together. This paper is
                 a first look into how multiple such overlays (all using
                 the same protocols) can be merged - which is critical for
                 usability and adoption of such an internet-scale
                 distributed system. We elaborate how two networks using
                 the same protocols can be merged, looking specifically
                 into two different overlay design principles: (i)
                 maintaining the ring invariant and (ii) structural
                 replications, either of which are used in various overlay
                 networks to guarantee functional correctness in a highly
                 dynamic (membership changes) environment. Particularly,
                 we show that ring based networks can not operate until
                 the merger operation completes. In contrast, from the
                 perspective of individual peers in structurally
                 replicated overlays there is no disruption of service,
                 and they can continue to discover and access resources
                 that they could originally do before the beginning of the
                 merger process, even though resources from the other
                 network become visible only gradually with the progress
                 of the merger process.},
